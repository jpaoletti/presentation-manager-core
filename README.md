# Presentation Manager - Core module

Presentation Manager is a framwork based on xml configuration files that
translate a data object model into a list of visual representation of such
named entities. Each entity defines how a model object should be shown and
which operations can be applied to them. This results on a CRUD tool with an
automatic visual implementation.

Presentation Manager (PM in short) is mainly designed to make the process of
developing administrative tools fast and scalable. Also provides flexibles
interfaces to make de visual implementation and data accessing independant of
the core so your object may come from any type of source (xml, json, DataBase)
with a simple interface implementation.
